# heimnet
Heimnet is a website with the purpose to make the process of buying and selling real estate easier. 
How it suppose to work initially:
1) The user enters a city/streetname/area in the Searchbar in the form. User can choose to add filter to the search (type of real estate i.e apartment, houses, min space, min size, max prixe etc). This search bar will be based on a google.maps API,
2) When user has enter all criterias, he submits by hiting the submit button
3) The user will be sent to a landing page where relevant real estate objects will be displayed, based on the search criteras. Thus each object is defined as an type of "ad" and all the "ads" will be sorted in a seperate container.
4) If the user clicks on a container he will be sent to the page for the ad. On this page all the details will be displayed about the object, i.e price, size, pictures, contact info to the real estate agent etc.


   Note!
   The landingpage is not yet been built, hopfully I will have time for it in the days to come
